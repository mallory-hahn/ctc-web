      <p class="slider__txt">We are engineers, mathematicians, scientistcs, and economists. We like thinking analytically, and our roles at CTC allow us to do just that. Whether it's in groups or on our own, we're always looking to further our research and move the company forward.</p>

      <p class="slider__txt">"One of the reasons I was so excited to work at CTC was the focus on continuing education. Throughout my life I have always loved school. I love learning something new, and having opportunities to continue to learn throughout my career was important to me. I was so excited to have found a company that puts so much time and effort into its internal education program. CTC offers classes on options theory, practical trading courses, coding, statistics and more. Additionally, we frequently bring in interesting outside speakers, sometimes on topics related to our business like data analysis or trading strategies, but other times on topics that we feel are in line with our culture and values. Finally, if there is something you need educationally for your career growth that CTC does not offer, CTC provides tuition reimbursement to help employees to expand their knowledge and competencies. CTC feels that education is essential in such a rapidly changing industry and we encourage employees to always be learning well after their “official” educational experiences have ended." -Deanna Williams, QTA</p>
        <h2 class="slider__caption">We're always learning</h2>

      <h2 class="slider__caption">We're supportive</h2>
      <p class="slider__txt">CTC is super excited about one of our newest initiatves: the Women's Group! While some of our most valuable relationships at the company are the informal mentorships that form authentically, we are also investing in formalizing the women's network at the company.
